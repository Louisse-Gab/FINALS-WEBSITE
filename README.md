# Shelter of Light

**Shelter of Light** is a pet adoption website dedicated to giving cats and dogs a second chance at life. Our platform connects adopters with animals in need, making the adoption process seamless, compassionate, and impactful.

## Website Sections

The website includes six main sections:

- **Home** – Introduces the Shelter of Light and its purpose. It features a live count of animals we've cared for (currently 9 animals: 6 dogs and 3 cats) and showcases the most recent successful adoptions.

- **About Us** – Tells the story of how Shelter of Light began, our mission and vision, and highlights heartwarming adoption stories of our rescued cats and dogs.

- **What We Do** – Showcases our outreach efforts including feeding programs, community collaborations, awareness initiatives, and volunteer activities that support animal welfare.

- **Donate** – A space where supporters can help sustain our mission through one-time or recurring donations to aid in food, medical care, and shelter.

- **Adopt** – A gallery of available pets. Users can view pet details and click "Adopt Me" to begin the adoption process.

- **Contact** – Provides contact information and a form for questions, feedback, or partnerships.
